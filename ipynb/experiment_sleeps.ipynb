    "Mean running speed for each1.6 s bin was also estimated. In the absence of EMG recordings, we could not unequivocally discriminate between slow wavesleep and quiet immmobility, we therefore restricted all analyses to epochs termed ‘rest’. Rest was defined as epochs with runningspeed < 2.5cm/s, and theta/delta power ratio < 2 and waking movement as theta/delta power ratio > 2 and speed > 2.5cm/s. Sharp-wave ripples were detected by first filtering the LFP in the band 100-250Hz. The instantaneous power of the filtered LFP was thenestimated by calculating the root mean square over 7ms intervals (MATLAB function ‘envelope’ with option ‘rms’). From all LFPsacross tetrodes in the CA1 layer, the LFP whose power estimate had the highest standard deviation was then used to define rippleevents, as 100ms windows around the peak power, whenever the power was greater than the 99thpercentile of all powers in the trial(approximately equal to 4 standard deviations above the mean). Multi-unit activity (MUA) bursts were defined by binning all spikesfrom CS cells into 1ms bins and smoothing the resulting binned spike train with a Gaussian kernel (s.d. 10ms). MUA events werethen defined as crossing of a threshold defined as 3 standard deviations above the mean of the smoothed spike train, with a durationfrom 100-750ms. \n",

Briefly, the awake state was marked by the presence oflow-amplitude fast activity associated with EMG tonus; SWS was identi-fied by continuous high-amplitude slow activity, regular appearance ofspindles, and decreased EMG activity. Transitions from SWS into REMsleep were identified by a decrease in high-amplitude slow activity, in-crease of theta activity, and presence of spindles. REM sleep was charac-terized by dominant theta activity, low-voltage fast activity, and an ab-sence of EMG tonus. Behavioral states were additionally verified by videorecording."
