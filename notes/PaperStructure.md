# Local Field Potential Study with Subicular spatial degradation

## Introduction
We did a previous study that focused on single-units.
Here we present more data, and also focus on the LFP signal in SUB and RSC (sometimes CA), as opposed to single-units.
This revealed that...

## Histology and electrode location

## Methods

### Cleaning the signals
1. Average all channels if not dead/obv noise based on SD
2. Detect possible noise periods by SD.
3. Smooth the signal.

And compare with

1. Perform ICA
2. Remove obviously noise components
3. Recombine

### T-maze decision point
Lots of work on this, but nothing concrete yet, think we are close though.


### Band-power calculations
This is in NC.

## Results

### Open-field recordings in CL (behaviour - 2)
Here we investigate band-powers, relationship between speed and phase of LFP signals, etc (e.g. coherence).
These are compared between control and lesion animals as a whole

### T-maze recordings in CL (behaviour - 3)
The decision made by the rat is decoded via Bayes (maybe - or ML), and the decoder accuracy is compared between CL.
John might have a good suggestion here.

### Sleep in CL (Shane thinks Prio - 1)
The power of the LFP signal, and presence of SWRs, is compared between CL.
Term it as rest in the paper though. ATNx vs ATN.
This is an obvious one.

### Muscimol recordings (4 - probably can go on the side)
The over time behaviour of the LFP signals are compared under the effects of muscimol, while accounting for speed and lack of exploration differences over time.
The decoder is also applied to any t-maze data in this.

## Discussion
Based on the results, we conclude that the spatial degradation may be linked to blah blah.
